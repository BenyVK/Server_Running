# Server_Running


Hi My Name is Benyamin

This server_always_run program works in such a way that after your server_exe is shut down
it automatically restarts it and does not let it remain shut down.
----------------------------------------------
It took approximately 2 hours to make. This version is complete and has no issues.

00 Note that if you want to run it for SAMP, you must run it in the same way as it is on the SAMP-server
but if you want to run it for open.mp, you must change the SAMP-server that is the source. 00
